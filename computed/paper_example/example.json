    "human_0": "The research involved 8,550 boys and girls aged between ten and 16 from 26 state schools in Essex. All were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different measures of fitness: stamina, handgrip strength and lower-body power. The results revealed that a child’s month of birth could make “significant” differences to their levels of cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate, all of which predict how good someone is at sports, in which such attributes are vital. Performances at school sports days in the weeks ahead may bear out the findings. November-born children were the fittest overall as they had the most stamina and power and were the second strongest. Those born in October were almost as fit, scoring highest for strength and coming third for power, with December children close behind.",

All were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different things: stamina, handgrip strength and lower-body power. The results showed that a child’s month of birth could make big differences to their levels of fitness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate,  all of which predict how good someone is at sports. November children were the fittest because they had the most stamina and power and were the second strongest. Children born in October were almost as fit – they scored highest for strength and came third for power, with December children close behind.",

    "gpt3_vocab": "The research involved a lot of boys and girls aged between ten and 16 from a bunch of state schools in Essex. All were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different measures of fitness, like how long they could keep going and how much they could lift. The results revealed that a child’s month of birth could make some pretty big differences to their levels of fitness, which predicts how good someone is at sports. Performances at school sports days in the weeks ahead may show the findings. November-born children were the fittest overall as they had the most stamina and power and were the second strongest. Those born in October were almost as fit, scoring highest for strength and coming third for power, with December children close behind."
